### Hi, I'm Kristina!

Pursuing my M.Sc. "Interactive Media Technology" in Computer Science at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. My curiosity and thirst for knowledge are quenched by working as a junior software engineer on the side. 

Technologies I work with mostly atm include e.g. _JavaScript, TypeScript, ReactJS_ and _NodeJS_.
